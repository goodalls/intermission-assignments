# Module 4 Intermission Assignments

## Filling Out Your Skill Set

1. To refamiliarize yourself with the HTTP request-response cycle, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eesqK59rhGA).
2. Read Eloquent JavaScript: [Chapter 17 - HTTP](http://eloquentjavascript.net/17_http.html) and [Chapter 20 - Node.js](http://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html). The exercises at the end of the chapters are great practice (your answers to these exercises will not be collected).
3. Complete this [lesson on writing a Node HTTP server](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-4/node-prework.html) - **Deliverable:** Walk through the lesson and code along; finish the functions `getAllMessages` and `addMessage` at the end of the lesson.
4. Complete the [tutorial for writing an Express server](https://medium.com/@jaeger.rob/introduction-to-nodes-express-js-db5617047150) - **Deliverable:** In addition to going through the tutorial, work on 3 out of 4 of the problems in the "Further Challenges" section at the end of the tutorial.
5. Watch [this video on RESTful APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLwpqD8n3d0), and then read these things [about RESTful API design](https://hackernoon.com/restful-api-designing-guidelines-the-best-practices-60e1d954e7c9).
6. Read about and practice writing [Promises](https://gist.github.com/robbiejaeger/dc8f55c1f9462741090862f736b82cab) - **Deliverable:** Write your own promises in the "Promise Approach: On Your Own" section
7. Become familiar with the git rebase workflow (you might need to use this on projects in module 4). Read this article on [git rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase) and this article on [merging vs. rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing).

*Note:* For the first project in module 4, you will have to use jQuery (you will not be able to use React or other frameworks in the first project, for instance). _Refresh your skills as needed._

## Prework Submission

You are expected to have the prework completed by day one of module 4. For the items marked as **Deliverable**, you will submit links to your finished work to a homework submission file. [This is the homework submission file](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1710/mod-4/homework-submissions.md).

To submit your prework assignments, make a pull request to add links to your finished work under your name. We will use this submission file for the rest of your homework throughout the module as well.
